Locking
=============

To ensure consistent writes, aerovaldb provides a locking mechanism which can be used to coordinate writes between multiple instances of aerovaldb. The lock applies on the entire database, not per-file.

For :class:`AerovalJsonFileDB` the locking mechanism uses a folder of lock files (`~/.aerovaldb/` by default) to coordinate the lock. It is important that the file system where the lock files are stored supports `fcntl <https://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl>`.

Overriding the lock-file directory
----------------------------------

To override the lock file directory, set the environment variable `AVDB_LOCK_DIR`

Example
-----------

The following example illustrates how to use locking in practice:

.. code-block:: python

    import aerovaldb

    with aerovaldb.open('json_files:.') as db:
        db.acquire_lock()
        data = db.get_by_uuid('./file.json', default={"counter": 0})
        data["counter"] += 1
        db.put_by_uuid(data, './file.json')
        db.release_lock()

- :meth:`~aerovaldb.jsondb.jsonfiledb.AerovalJsonFileDB.acquire_lock`
- :meth:`~aerovaldb.jsondb.jsonfiledb.AerovalJsonFileDB.release_lock`
- :meth:`~aerovaldb.jsondb.jsonfiledb.AerovalJsonFileDB.is_locked`

Limitations
------------

- Locking will not work for multiple instances of aerovaldb which are configured with different locking directories.
- Locking will not prevent other programs that don't use aerovaldb to access the files from reading or writing the files.
